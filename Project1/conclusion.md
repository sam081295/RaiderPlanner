# Conclusion

The only issue that arose for me is that I started doing work without first creating a branch which caused organizational issues. Thankfully I had not committed too much work and was able to revert
the changes and redo them properly on the branch itself.

Regardless, I actually enjoyed using Git, and I will definitely use it in my future projects where possible. Version control is my biggest weakness, and Git works just fine.

My opinions on using Github and any issues that arose: I tried for 3-4 days to fix a large unforeseen issue that still couldn't be fixed in the end. When I edited code through Eclipse or even when I tried with Notepad, the Git client didn't register an update. I could create new files and it would instantly register, so this was a huge frustration. In the end I wasn't able to fix the issue I picked anyways.  I plan on playing more with Github to figure out what I am doing wrong. Even though I couldn't register my coding changes, I was still able to branch, merge, push, pull, and commit. 

As for working on a larger project I can really see how important Github is. It is great allowing people to work on their own branch and merge things together. I think if I were able to get it to work, I would appreciate it even more.

I thought the project was pretty fun, although to be honest I was happy to be the fork owner and not to have to do a fix on the RaiderPlanner code this time. Still, there was plenty of other stuff to do, and I definitely thought using git and github was the fun part of all this. I was happy to get more experience with these tools, and to refresh my memory.

I had a mistake which I talked about in my d-nedrow.md file on pull requests. I tried to pull down one of the requests into a branch which contained untracked files. This caused the merge part of the pull not to work because of a conflict, and it temporarily confused me as to what was going on. I was happy to learn about the importance of being in a clean state with regards to untracked files before trying to do a merge.

There was another time when I just started editing a file I had pulled down to fix a small mistake, and I basically just completely forgot I was using version control at all! I just wanted to make this trivial edit and immediately push it back up to github, but of course I needed to stage it and commit it. This is just a lesson not to get too hasty to finish simple work and forget you are using git.

Working on the issue wasn't super difficult but since this was my first time really using git, I had to research how to make my first commit and look up new git commands. I had an issue making my first commit as I forgot to create my own branch and accidentally added
to the main branch which was an issue. To fix this, I unstaged using the command "git reset HEAD" and then proceeded to create my own
branch and add to that. Overall that wasn't super hard to fix fortunately and learned from that mistake!

Overall I feel like I learned a lot of the basic features of git from this first project. I am glad that we had more emphasis on working more with git versus resolving the issues. I think that gave students who were new to git more room for learning the software.
